# BEnMap
A map interface to display the Building Energy (BEn) use that has been publicized through recent building energy reporting laws.

The goal of the interface is to enable one to answer the following questions:

How does the energy intensity of the buildings in one's daily life compare with neighbors?
Who are the biggest energy hogs in one's city and what are the buildings setting good precedents?
Where are the biggest opportunities for energy retrofits?
What are the buildings that are greenwashing the most?
